        <h5><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h5>
        
        <p>
            We're a dedicated, passionate group that works with a small collection of businesses very closely. In fact, we don't have clients, we have friends and business "partners" with whom we share a dream. We do our best work and have the most impact when we work with people we believe in and who believe in us.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Weâ€™re not a good fit for everyone.</strong>
            <br/>
            We work with big and small businesses, but sometimes budget, schedule, or differences get in the way. And that's OK. Really. There's always the next one.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>We're not "tools".</strong><br/>
            If you're looking for design robots to simply do your bidding... yeah, that's not us. We've been doing this, and doing it well for quite a while now. So when we work together, we'll fight for what we believe is in your best interest. Sometimes we might lose the fight - but don't expect us to stop recommending what we think is best. In the end though, we'll always find a way to "make it work."

        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Can you afford us?</strong><br/>
            Probably. We're not the cheapest and we're not the most expensive. But we are reasonable and (in our humble opinion) a fantastic value. We work hard and passionately for our clients - and we only have one speed; FULL. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Our typical engagement....</strong><br/>
            
            We'll work with businesses of all sizes; we're not snooty. But we do tend to work better with those that understand and appreciate the value we add. Some of our clients have worked with "us" for years following "us" from one agency to another. That makes us smile. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Typically we work with clients over the long term to achieve their goals. But that doesn't mean we won't do some smaller project work. We know, sometimes budgets are an issue, and we'll be happy to conceive ways to achieve results even when funds are tight. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So If you think we might be a good fit...or you have questions - give us a call or just an email, we're friendly folks, we don't bite, and we'll be happy to provide you a proposal.

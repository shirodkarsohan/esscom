        <h5><strong>WORK PROCESS</strong> </h5>
        
        <p>
            We begin each new relationship by getting to know you and your business. We learn about your strengths, your weakness, your competition, and your marketplace. Most importantly, we learn about your customers and prospects. We discover who they are and what motivates them.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            During the entire process we're working with you. Our process is simple. Figure out what works. Avoid what doesn't. And keep adapting to keep prospects and customers engaged - and buying!
        </p>

            <strong>Do we get results?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The simple answer, yes. How quickly and how much, well that depends. We'd love to tell you we have some magic formula that works overnight, but then again if we did, we'd be retired and doing fishing in the pond.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Results take hard work!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes we can make simple changes and improve results quickly. Other times it takes a little while for the improvements we make to take effect. But we keep working, improving, tweaking, and measuring to make sure results are increasing.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
            <strong>The proof is in the pudding!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            As the old saying goes, our best proof of results, is our past successes. We've helped lots of companies, big and small, solve tough marketing problems. More importantly, we've helped them grow sales and gain customers. 

            We've helped small start-ups or mid-size firms, we've increased engagement and grown revenue. But we're not braggarts, but get us alone over coffee...and we'll be happy to share.
